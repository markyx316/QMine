## 1. Status — last updated 2026-08-19

| | |
|---|---|
| Tests | **138 passing**; `ruff --select F` clean but for 3 pre-existing style warnings |
| Verified **live** (real agents) | phases p0–p2b only, on a **12k subsample** |
| Verified **offline** (stand-in) | all 12 phases, incl. reports, notebook, 11 figures |
| Never run | the full 50k corpus with live agents |
| Live spend to date | ~$38 across 4 attempts |

**Next action:** the full-50k live run. Everything since `live20` — the AMI-based K
rule, `partition_stability`, battery-as-probe, gold sizing 600→3000, the audit trail,
the annotator-ceiling pilot — has only ever run offline.

```bash
cd "/Users/mayouxuan/Documents/Claude/Search Query Mining Agent Team/QMine"
mkdir -p runs/live21 && cp -r runs/live20/llm_cache runs/live21/llm_cache   # saves ~35 min
HF_HOME=$(pwd)/.hf caffeinate -i .venv/bin/qmine run \

## 2. Open questions — EDIT THIS SECTION, DO NOT APPEND

1. **Does the guide repair help? First clean answer: no measurable effect.**
   `live20` produced the first uncontaminated comparison — both rounds at **n=596**,
   full annotator coverage on both sides, all 28 repair rules delivered:

   ```json
   [{"round": 1, "kappa": 0.8335, "n": 596, "raw_agreement": 0.849, "sample": "initial"},
    {"round": 2, "kappa": 0.8311, "n": 596, "raw_agreement": 0.849, "sample": "fresh"}]
   ```

   **Δκ = −0.002**, against a standard error of roughly 0.016 at this n — about
   0.1 SE, i.e. flat. Raw agreement is identical to four decimal places (0.849 both
   rounds), which is the more striking number: the two rounds are indistinguishable.

   So the machinery works — 8 of 8 open boundaries decided, 28 of 28 rules delivered,
   the guide rewritten, a fresh disjoint sample annotated — and **agreement does not
   move**. The honest reading is that marker-based boundary rules are not the binding
   constraint on annotator agreement here, which is consistent with the earlier
   finding that this corpus's disagreement is *diffuse* across ~40 pairs rather than
   concentrated in a few.

   Open for tomorrow: is the effect genuinely zero, or too small to see at 596? At
   3,000 rows the resolvable effect size drops to roughly 0.015. Worth one run to
   find out — and if it is still flat, the repair loop should probably be demoted
   from a gate remedy to a diagnostic that reports contested boundaries without
   claiming to fix them.
2. **The comparison design is still confounded.** Round 1 is scored on sample A and
   round 2 on sample B, so the delta mixes "guide improved" with "sample differed".
   The clean fix is a **control arm** — annotate sample B with the *old* guide too —
   at the cost of one extra annotation pass. Not built; the code now at least refuses
   to present the two numbers as comparable (`comparable: false` in the artifact).
3. **`_dedupe_rules` cannot see semantic contradictions.** It catches lexical
   duplicates; two rules that mean the same thing in different words slip through.
   The serialized referee is the mitigation, not the filter.
4. **Three domain profiles are untested on real data:** `finance_zh`, `sports_zh`,
   `politics_zh`.
5. **`n_prescriptions` is 0 on every halt so far.** A halted run tells the operator
   what failed but issues no structured prescription for fixing it.

---

## 3. Durable notes — worth not re-learning

- `runs/*/llm_cache` is keyed on `(role, provider, model, system, user, schema)` and
  **not** on `max_tokens` — so token-budget changes do not invalidate it. Copying a
  cache directory into a new run is a legitimate way to skip replayable work.
  Web-research calls will still miss, because the fetched content differs each time.
- The offline stand-in produces a **degenerate taxonomy** (one node,
  `[offline-heuristic] code`), so `td_l1_name` is legitimately empty in offline runs.
  The code reports that rather than shipping a column of blanks.
- `completed_phases` uses an `operator.add` reducer — it cannot be pruned via
  `update_state`. Rewind by graph **position** (`as_node=<predecessor>`) instead.
- `qmine` has no `new-generation` command; `runner.new_generation()` exists but is
  not exposed on the CLI.
- Verify a live run really used live agents: `run_summary.json` →
  `llm_usage.provider` must read `routed`, not `offline`.

## 4. Session 1 (2026-08-18) — deliverables, providers, guide repair

### Deliverables now match the reference documents

- **`report/zh_figures.py` (new)** — the six-figure suite modelled on
  `K12_Embedding_Attempts_Comparison.ipynb`: K-sweep three-panel, α-decision with a
  phrasing-vote secondary axis, algorithm-battery scatter, embedding-space
  projections, per-intent split with `exp(H)` effective-family counts, and the
  uniform panel as bars with advisory metrics hatched. The notebook had **one**
  figure before; the reference carries six.
- **Figure production unified.** The report and the notebook each drew their own
  K-sweep, α, UMAP and panel charts — two different pictures of the same number in
  one deliverable. The notebook now executes first and its figures fill those slots,
  with `ops/viz` as fallback. Guarded by `test_one_figure_per_quantity`.
- **Both routes are equal citizens in `labels_full.csv`.** Bottom-up shipped 8
  columns including a margin and an ambiguity flag; top-down shipped 2 bare codes.
  Top-down now also has `td_l1_name`, `td_user_need`, `td_confidence`, `td_margin`,
  `td_ambiguous`, `td_decided_by` (`rule` vs `model`). `td_ambiguous` uses the same
  threshold as `bu_ambiguous` so the word means one thing.
- **`route_crosswalk.csv` (new)** — per bottom-up family: dominant top-down L1, its
  share, classes touched, `exp(H)` effective classes, and a verdict of
  `routes agree` / `partial overlap` / `routes disagree`. Neither route is an answer
  key, so the useful artifact is a map of where they concur.

### Gold-set sizing — a real deviation from the playbook, now fixed

`gold_sample_size` was hardcoded at **600**. The playbook says
`分层抽 3,000-5,000 条` (line 191) and separately `<1 万条 → 金标比例提高`
(line 119) — a small corpus needs a higher *proportion*, not the same absolute
count. A constant satisfied neither.

`config.gold_size_for()` now derives it: 3,000 on a 12k+ corpus, a rising share
below 10k, capped so gold can never become most of the corpus. Pin
`taxonomy.gold_sample_size` to an integer to force a cheap run.

**`p2a_pilot_agreement` now exists.** It was in the blocking-gates list and emitted
by no node. 50 queries, four LLM calls, hard stop below 85% agreement, reporting the
top confused pairs. This is what makes a 3,000-row gold set affordable — it catches
an ambiguous guide before the expensive annotation, per
`一致率 <85% 则回炉改指南/裁决规则, 而非直接开标`.

### The guide-repair loop (playbook `达不到先修指南再重标`)

Was absent entirely: κ was measured once, *before* the referee's rules existed, and
the gate's own `remediation` string said "fold the referee's rules into the guide and
re-annotate" — printed, never executed.

Now, when κ misses: find boundaries the referee resolved **inconsistently**, settle
each from rows **both annotators agreed on** (`discriminating_markers`, greedy set
cover, deterministic tie-break), add a `boundary_default` for marker-less queries
only where the agreed rows lean ≥75%, rewrite the guide, and re-annotate a **fresh
disjoint sample**.

**Known open question — see §4.** Whether this actually raises κ is still unproven.

### Provider and infrastructure fixes

| Defect | Effect | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `resolve_base_url` cached a host after *every* probe errored | One transient failure pinned the process to a host that had just 401'd — 48 auth errors, an annotator lost 24 batches mid-run | Never cache a host we have evidence against; serialise the probe behind a lock |
| Global `max_tokens=16000` overrode per-role budgets | Taxonomy architect truncated at exactly 16001 tokens, twice | Role budget is authoritative, bounded only by the model's published ceiling |
| `_native_schema_is_broken` only matched `ValidationError` | DashScope's `response_format unavailable` and `must contain the word 'json'` were never learned; every call wasted an attempt | Both patterns added |
| Annotator batch failure → `return {}` | 400 rows became `UNLABELED` silently | Retry ×3 with backoff, then report the loss loudly |
| `agreement()` counted `UNLABELED` as disagreement | Charged infrastructure failures to the methodology; cost 0.008 κ | Excluded and counted as `n_unscored_unlabelled` |
| `p2b_kappa` reported a verdict at 33% coverage | "κ 0.813" read as a judgement on the guide; it described the survivors | `min_annotation_coverage` (0.90) → `MEASUREMENT UNSOUND`, neither pass nor fail |

### Correctness fixes found by running, not reading

- **`stratified_sample` returned index *labels* in its stratified branch and
  *positions* in the other two.** They coincide on a `RangeIndex` — which every
  caller had always passed — so passing `df.iloc[unseen]` blew up with
  `IndexError: index 11410 out of bounds for size 11400`. Fixed at the contract:
  positional in all three branches.
- **`select_active_learning_batch` called `len()` on a scipy sparse matrix.** Round-2
  active learning had *never once run* in this codebase; the exception was swallowed
  into a one-line log message. Fixed, plus the caller's `diversity_fraction=0.0`
  workaround removed — the diversity pass works fine on sparse, it was routing around
  a bug one line earlier.
- **The notebook executed against the wrong Python.** `kernel_name="python3"`
  resolved through the user's Jupyter kernelspecs to an unrelated project's venv
  lacking `pyarrow`; cell 1 raised and every figure below silently never drew. Now
  pinned to `sys.executable`.
- **`_dedupe_rules` was a rule-set shredder.** It compared rendered `when` sentences,
  where two markers for one boundary differ by ~2 characters in 45 (0.957 similar).
  It flagged every legitimate discriminating pair as a contradiction and withheld
  *both* halves — **9 of 41 rules survived**. Now compares structured
  `(class pair, trigger)` keys. Measured live tonight: **28/28**.
- **Rules could name a class that does not exist.** `R12 → 选 EXOD_INFO` against a
  taxonomy declaring `EXAM_INFO`, rendered verbatim into both annotators' prompts.
  Now validated at 2a and repaired by a dominance test.
- **A failed referee batch stamped `adjudicated=True`** on rows with no referee
  behind them, silently favouring annotator A. Now left visibly unresolved.
- **Resume could not tell a crash from a refusal.** Three separate gaps: it replayed
  the halt instead of retrying; clearing the flag still skipped the phase because the
  checkpoint stores *position*; and a cleared-but-unrewound checkpoint reported
  **success for a pipeline that stopped at phase three**. Now `halt_kind`
  (`crash`/`gate`/`review`) plus position derived from `completed_phases`.

### Live attempts — what each cost and taught

| run | outcome | cost | lesson |
|---|---|---|---|
| live01–02 | died at P2a | ~$7 | fenced JSON; 16k token truncation |
| live05 | crashed in the repair round | $6.72 | `stratified_sample` label/position contract |
| live10 | halted p2b, κ 0.813 on **199/600** | $7.39 | poisoned region cache; κ was an artifact, not a result |
| live20 | halted p2b, κ 0.831 on **596/596** — a sound measurement | $16.67 | first clean repair readout: **Δκ = −0.002**, i.e. no effect |

Roughly **$38** spent on live runs. Every failure was a distinct real defect, all
fixed with regression tests.

## 5. Session 2 (2026-08-19) — decision architecture, audit trail, portability

**Verdict on the playbook: mostly right, targeted repair — not redesign.** Five
independent audits agreed. The phase ORDER is correct and a joint grid search is
measurably *worse* (held-out ARI 0.653 vs greedy 0.739 at 3.4-4.7x the cost;
measured directly: 819 s for a 50-cell (alpha x K) surface on only 4k rows, and
greedy's alpha was already optimal at the final K). The defect was never the
sequence — it was **reading single noisy draws as truth**.

### K selection was noise
Replay stability's seed-to-seed sd is ~0.10; the gaps between adjacent K are ~0.05.
Four draws at one K gave 0.63 / 0.60 / 0.38 / 0.69. A tie-aware selector returns
**the whole grid**. It is also degenerate: K=2 scores ARI **1.0000** on both the 8k
and the real 50k corpus, so only the `k_sweep` list's hardcoded lower bound stood
between the pipeline and a two-way split. `expected_family_range` never constrained
anything.

**Now:** stability only *rejects* (a reproducibility floor — the role the literature
gives it); K is *located* by **AMI against the phrasing groups**, the one metric here
with a two-sided penalty and therefore an interior optimum (0.427 at K=2 → 0.724 at
K=25 → 0.664 at K=100), and **~10x more precise** (sd 0.005-0.023). It yields a
unique winner where stability ties everything. Runs now ship a **tie set** — the
honest answer, and the "several equally-good results" deliverable.

Dead ends not worth repeating: raw fragmentation is *structurally* monotone in K
(rho +0.97…+1.00 in all 13 runs) so it prefers K=1; the chance-adjusted version
(`adjusted_template_fragmentation`, implemented) prefers K=∞. Neither locates K.
Both are valid at *fixed* K, which is why alpha selection was always sound.

### Other confirmed defects, fixed
- **The panel measured the wrong object.** `stability_ari` was `replay_stability(X, k)`
  — corpus and cluster count only — so the "decisive" number on the delivered leaves
  described a fresh KMeans run and was pessimistic by ~0.25 ARI. Now
  `partition_stability`: half-sample centroid replay on the actual partition
  (leaves 0.893 ± 0.007 vs the 0.640 previously reported).
- **The algorithm battery was decorative** — `build_hierarchy` hardcodes KMeans, and
  the report announced `gmm_diag_k15` as the winner while arguing why KMeans is
  right. Now a falsification probe, and the report says so.
- **The pilot gate was dropped on the floor** — `deps.gate(...)` called without
  capturing the return, so it could never halt anything. My own
  `declared_gates_never_evaluated` diagnostic named it in five runs.

### The audit trail is now IN the deliverable
Previously the run recorded 7 decisions, 10 gates, 5 prescriptions and 332 agent
calls, and the report rendered roughly half the decisions and none of the rest.
Added as sections 9-11, in execution order:
- **§9 全流程决策链** — every decision with candidates, winner, who decided, decisive
  metric, full rationale, and the rejected options with their numbers. Plus
  `fig_decision_chain` (candidates → survivors per step).
- **§10 质量门总账** — every gate with observed vs threshold and its remediation, plus
  gates declared blocking that never fired. Plus `fig_gates` (headroom, normalised).
- **§11 治理台账** — every prescription's final disposition.

All authored rationale/remediation prose is translated via `report/i18n.prose()`,
guarded by `test_every_authored_rationale_reaches_the_reader_in_the_report_language`
which fails on any untranslated line reaching a Chinese report — it caught a string
I added minutes later.

**State:** 134 tests pass; report 15 sections / 664 lines / **0 lines of English**;
11 figures; notebook executes with 0 errors.
